# Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita between 1950-2018

Using the existing dataset of the Life expectancy and GDP per captia between 1950 and 2018 (when available) for all available countries in the world, this project illustrates and highlights the basic statistical data along with different Exploratory Data Analysis methods, Spatial Analysis, and Time series analysis using Python and the respective libraries.
